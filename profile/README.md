# Sassy Bulldog

Welcome to the official GitHub organization profile of Sassy Bulldog. We're here
to make your coding experience as delightful as a bulldog in a tutu.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community. To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Identify the repository you wish to contribute to. (Hint: It's the one with
   the most stars. Everyone loves stars.)
2. Request to be added as an external contributor by contacting us. Carrier
   pigeons are preferred, but GitHub messages will do.
3. Once granted permissions, create a new branch using our naming convention:
   `[type]/[purpose]` (e.g., `feat/add-dog-treats-feature` or `fix/bug-123`).
   Creative names like `feat/add-unicorns` are also welcome.
4. Make your changes and commit them following the
   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)
   standard (e.g., `feat: add dog treats feature` or `fix: resolve bug 123`).
   Bonus points for puns.
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feat/add-dog-treats-feature`).
   If you hear a bark, it means it worked.
6. Create a new Pull Request. Add a funny GIF to make our day.

Please make sure to follow our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and
[Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
We take our code seriously, but not ourselves.

## Contact Us

For any inquiries or support, please contact us through GitHub. Smoke signals
and howling at the moon are also acceptable.

Thank you for visiting our GitHub organization profile! We hope you enjoy your
stay as much as a bulldog enjoys a belly rub.
